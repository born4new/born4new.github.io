	      Our goal here is to <strong>quantify the racial bias of a particular police officer</strong> (informally, a cop).
		  To quantify the level of racial bias of a cop in his stop decision process, we have started from the following statement: 
		  if we observe the distribution of the race of drivers stopped by an officer when it is dark (i.e., when a cop can not see the driverâ€™s race), 
		  we can know the true distribution of traffic violation over all races that an officer can observe. 
		  Then, if we compare this distribution to the race driver stopped distribution when it is light, 
		  a difference from the night distribution highlights a racial bias in stop decision.

		  More technically, for each officer, we have followed these steps:

		  1. We capture the number of black, Hispanic and white driver stopped when it is light and when it is dark:

	    <p class="text">
		  where r is the driver race (b: black, h: hispanic, w: white) and t the lighting when the stop is done (l: light, d: dark).
		</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
		<p class="text">
	      2. We compute the proportion of driver race r stopped when it is light and when it is dark:

	  </div>
	  <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
		<p class="text">
		  3. We compute the ratio of the proportion of race drivers r stopped when it is light over the proportion of races driver r 
		  stopped when it is dark:

	  <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
		<p class="text">
		  4. We compute the ratio of the previous ratio of race driver r over the sum of all previous ratio, we center it 
		  (here we have 3 races, so we center by 1/3, since it is the perfect ratio when there is no racial bias) and 
		  pick the absolute value:

	  <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
		<p class="text">
		  5. We compute our final coefficient using exponential to penalize more big-ratio differences:

		<p class="text">
		  <strong>The higher that number, the more racially biased that cop is</strong>: this is our classification criterion for so called "Good Cops" and "Bad Cops".
