          We then want to understand in which cities our good cops/bad cops are located in the US.

          On this boxplot we can see Plano is not doing good at
            all but one should remember that this city has 
            very few datapoints. Cities such as Nashville
            and Charlotte display right-heavy tailed distributions.
            Interestingly in some cities (Charlotte, Nashville) there seem to be quite a few officers with a racial bias which jumps
            as much as 2 times away the length of Interquatile range (Q3 - Q1) 
            from the third quartile. This means in those cities there are officers 
            which present a particularly high racial bias in comparison to their peers.

        <p>The maps that follow show the racial bias of officers accross the USA in multiple cities.
          One can play with the quantile selector in order to visualize
          what is the racial bias in each city for a specific quantile.
          Interestingly even though there are lot of neighbouring cities
          near Charlotte (Eastern part of the USA) all those cities have
          notably different racial biases. One of those cities displays a racial bias at the bottom-most
          part of the range of existing racial bias, when another city shows a racial bias
          which is at the top-most part of the racial bias range of values.
          Sadly we do not have enough cities' data to draw big conclusions about a general tendency
          of racial bias in certain regions of the USA. But those disparities of the racial bias values in close by cities
          either suggest that we have outliers or that cities in the USA generally have different law enforcement
          schemes. Maybe the chain of commands are different in those cities and this is what influences
          the racial bias of officers the most?
