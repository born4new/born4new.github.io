                <p class="text-left">
                    In this part we analyze how police officers' use of force varies depending on the skin colour of the
                    subject of a police stop.
                    In order to study this variable we focused on the police district of San Jose (California) which was
                    the sole district describing
                    the use of force by police officers during a police stop. We had to limit ourselves to a global
                    study of the use
                    of force by police officers by the whole department rather than studying individual police officers
                    racial bias for
                    the use of force since officers id were not indicated in the data which impeached us linking arrests
                    together.

                    After cleaning up the dataset we found the following force types were described:
                    The fact that someone was handcuffed, "no curb", making someone sit in the police vehicle. We
                    dropped
                    the "no curb" because
                    we could not find out what it meant. We set that force was used either when someone was handcuffed,
                    or when someone
                    was ordered to sit into the police vehicle.

                    There exists a difference between how much use of force is applied
                    between races. Black people and hispanic are the ones that are most
                    subject to force. For black persons a recorded use of force
                    appears 11.3% of the time during a police stop. This is higher than the 7.7%
                    of white people and the 5% for people that are asian/pacific islander.
                    Also for hispanic and black people a bigger number of police stops does not even describe
                    if police force was used or not. It is hard to describe if it means anything.

                    Another point which caught our eye in this plot is that people who are not assimilated
                    to any race are significantly more often subject to any use of force. Is not describing a subject
                    race
                    when force is actually used a way to hide the usage of force on a minority?

                    We now focus on the times when force is used in order to describe what are the reasons
                    for using force on different populations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason which may seem the most reasonable to use force for would be in our sense
                    when someone is armed with a weapon. This reason is 1.7 more prevalent for black
                    people compared to other population. For hispanic people it is 1,54 more prevalent than for white people.
                    But one has to remember that the numbers are pretty low here. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Officer safety seems to be a pretty vague reason to use force for. There is a difference of 10% between
                    the proportion of black people to which force is applied and the proportion to which force is applied on asian people.  
                    The "other" category for subject race seems to appear less in this "officer safety" reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another vague reason is the "not described" reason. This time "not described" is twice more prevalent for people
                    that have been assigned "other" as a subject race than for hispanic and black persons. But also this vague reason
                    is also assigned more often to white and asian ethnicities which have numbers closer to the "other" category.
