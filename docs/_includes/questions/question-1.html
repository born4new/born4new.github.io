          We first want to understand the distribution of our data, namely, the distribution of the <strong>4'584'165 police officers</strong> we have at our disposal in the original dataset.
        </p>

          As visible on the left-hand side, <strong>most police officers are in their 20s and are in their first year of work</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The age is pretty well distributed between 25 and 50-years-old otherwise: we have <strong>68% of all police officers in between those two ages</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          As for the overall experience, <strong>44% of all officers are in their first year in the line of duty</strong> (<strong>57% in their first three years</strong>, and <strong>64% in their five years</strong>)
        </p>

        <img src="img/question-1/officers_gender.png" alt="Officers gender" width="45%">

        <p class="text">
          Now, to the genders. Most police officers are men <strong>with an overwhelming majority at 87%</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Women are represented at <strong>6.28%</strong>, and the remainder is unknown: data has not been provided in the initial dataset.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text">
          The races distribution look disproportionate at first sight,
          but <strong>is actually very close to the distribution of races in the united states</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Indeed, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219" target="_blank">US census of 2019</a>, there were 76% of whites, 13.4% of blacks, and 18.5% of hispanics.
