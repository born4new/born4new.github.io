          To conclude our series of questions, we will take a closer look at <strong>the actions that police officers take when stopping car drivers</strong>.

          As visible on the left-hand side, <strong>most police officers are in their 20s and are in their first year of work</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The age is pretty well distributed between 25 and 50-years-old otherwise: we have <strong>68% of all police officers in between those two ages</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          As for the overall experience, <strong>44% of all officers are in their first year in the line of duty</strong> (<strong>57% in their first three years</strong>, and <strong>64% in their five years</strong>)

        </p>

        <p>
          Women are represented at <strong>6.28%</strong>, and the remainder is unknown: data has not been provided in the initial dataset.

        <p class="text">
          The races distribution look disproportionate at first sight,
          but <strong>is actually very close to the distribution of races in the united states</strong>.
