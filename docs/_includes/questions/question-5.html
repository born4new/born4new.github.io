        <p class="text-center">
          To conclude our series of questions, we will take a closer look at <strong>the actions that police officers take when stopping car drivers</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center">
          We will do this investigation in two parts: we will first look at the most common actions that Cops do when stopping car drivers.

          We will then compare the actions that Goop Cops and Bad Cops are undertaking when stopping car drivers.

      <p>
        Police Officers have several actions that they can perform when stopping car drivers. The 6 possible options in this dataset are:

        <ul>

          <li><u>Frisk Performed:</u> A physical search was made</li>

        Below are the actions that Police Officers took in California, in the datasets we had available from that study.

      <p>To have correct conclusions about the data, there are a few things to keep in mind...</p>
      
      <p>
        First of all, <strong>not every county/state will report its data the same way</strong>: different data will be
        available depending on the city/state mentioned.
      
        If you look at San Francisco, CA, one could think that the Police did not have perform a single frisk in 15 years,
        but that is unfortunately not the case: it is just that San Francisco data did not contain mentions of frisking (for a
        list of which dataset contains which actions possible, we will refer you to <a
          target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">the data section of the original study's website</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Secondly, an astute viewer will quickly realize that the columns do not necessarily add up to 100%, and sometimes to
        way more than 100%.

        It is in part due to the fact that some police units will always use the field citation_issued as a base, in
        conjunction with the other actions taken. In those scenarios, citation_issued will be close or equal to 100%.

        Another reason is that some entries do not contain any of the six actions, and therefore are the "dark matter" of
        those plots.

        There are <a target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">a lot of datasets available</a>, and we have generated
        most
