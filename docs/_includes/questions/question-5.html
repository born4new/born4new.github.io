        <hr class="light">
        <p class="text-center">
          To conclude our series of questions, we will take a closer look at <strong>the actions that police officers take when stopping car drivers</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center">
          We will do this investigation in two parts: we will first look at the most common actions that Cops do when stopping car drivers.

          We will then compare the actions that Goop Cops and Bad Cops are undertaking when stopping car drivers.

          As visible on the left-hand side, <strong>most police officers are in their 20s and are in their first year of work</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The age is pretty well distributed between 25 and 50-years-old otherwise: we have <strong>68% of all police officers in between those two ages</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          As for the overall experience, <strong>44% of all officers are in their first year in the line of duty</strong> (<strong>57% in their first three years</strong>, and <strong>64% in their five years</strong>)

          Now, to the genders. Most police officers are men <strong>with an overwhelming majority at 87%</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Women are represented at <strong>6.28%</strong>, and the remainder is unknown: data has not been provided in the initial dataset.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text">
          The races distribution look disproportionate at first sight,
          but <strong>is actually very close to the distribution of races in the united states</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Indeed, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219" target="_blank">US census of 2019</a>, there were 76% of whites, 13.4% of blacks, and 18.5% of hispanics.
