        <p class="text-center">
          To conclude our series of questions, we will take a closer look at <strong>the actions that police officers take when stopping car drivers</strong>.

        <p class="text-center">
          We will do this investigation in two parts: we will first look at the most common actions that Cops do when stopping car drivers.

          We will then compare the actions that Goop Cops and Bad Cops are undertaking when stopping car drivers.

      <h3>Part 1 - What actions do Cops take when arresting people?</h3>
      <hr class="light">

      <p>
        Police Officers have several actions that they can perform when stopping car drivers. The 6 possible options in this dataset are:

        <ul>
          <li><u>Citation Issued:</u> This is a fine that the driver will have to pay</li>
          <li><u>Warning Issued:</u> No fine: just a warning (pfew!)</li>
          <li><u>Arrest Made:</u> The driver was arrested</li>
          <li><u>Frisk Performed:</u> A physical search was made</li>
          <li><u>Search Conducted:</u> The car got searched for illegal possessions</li>

        Below are the actions that Police Officers took in California, in the datasets we had available from that study.

        In those plots and in the majority of the other plots, we see that the main actions that Police Officers will undertake are giving fines and warnings to drivers.
        Unfortunately, as presented in the original papers, the stops preceding those actions are biased towards minorities.
      </p>

      <p>To have correct conclusions about the data presented though, there are a few things to keep in mind...</p>
      
      <p>
        First of all, <strong>not every county/state will report its data the same way</strong>: different data will be
        available depending on the city/state mentioned.
      
        If you look at San Francisco, CA, one could think that the Police did not have perform a single frisk in 15 years,
        but that is unfortunately not the case: it is just that San Francisco data did not contain mentions of frisking (for a
        list of which dataset contains which actions possible, we will refer you to <a
          target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">the data section of the original study's website</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Secondly, an astute viewer will quickly realize that the columns do not necessarily add up to 100%, and sometimes to
        way more than 100%.

        It is in part due to the fact that some police units will always use the field citation_issued as a base, in
        conjunction with the other actions taken. In those scenarios, citation_issued will be close or equal to 100%.

        Another reason is that some entries do not contain any of the six actions, and therefore are the "dark matter" of
        those plots.

        There are <a target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">a lot of datasets available</a>, and we have generated
        most
        the plots for most of the datasets <a

      <h3>Part 2 - What actions do Good Cops/Bad Cops take when arresting people?</h3>
      <hr class="light">
    
      <p class="text-center">
        In this section, <strong>we will compare the behaviour of "Good Cops" and "Bad Cops"</strong>. We will have a look at the actions taken by the two groups, and try to draw some meaningful insights from those.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        The process to obtain that data is relatively straightforward: we have added a Racial Bias Coefficient (RBC) to all of the data we could,
        and for each city/state, <strong>we have computed the mean of the RBC for all Police Officers</strong>.

        Let us call this mean RBC <strong>the RBC threshold</strong>. We then use this RBC threshold that will locally 
        (i.e. in a given city/county/state) define a Good Cop and a Bad Cop: if the RBC of a given Police Officer is
        below the RBC threshold, he/she is part of the Good Cops. Otherwise, he/she is part of the Bad Cops.
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, we construct two separate arrests datasets (i.e. one for the Good Cops, and one for the Bad Cops), we run our computations on those, and we compare the results!

        As shown in the plots above, one can see that the Good Cops / Bad Cops in the states of Connecticut and Michigan do not differ greatly in their actions!

        We can note in Connecticut that the Good Cops seems to have more "luck" (or "flair") when it comes to searching for drugs than their more biased counterparts.

        The situation is actually opposite in the town of Winston-Salem, NC when it comes to found contraband!

        Lastly, we can see that Bad Cops in Michigan seem more forgiving than their Good Cops colleagues, as they give less contraventions, and more warnings!
