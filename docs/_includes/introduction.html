          This data story is a creative extension of the Standford Paper entitled <a target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/publications/">"A large-scale analysis of racial 
            disparities in police stops across the United States"</a>, where the authors analysed the racial bias that some US police officers suffer from against minorities 
            when doing police stops.

        <p class="text">
          In this extension, we would like to go a step back and <em>study the police officers in that study</em>.

          In regards to racial bias, we will try to understand <strong>what makes a good cop, and what makes a bad cop?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          To that end, we have come up with a formula that we call the <a href="#gcbc-formula">Good Cop, Bad Cop Formula (a.k.a. the GCBC formula)</a>,
          that we will use as the basic data for our analysis: this will be the atom in our new dataset if you will.
