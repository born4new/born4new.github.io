          This data story is a creative extension of the Stanford Paper entitled <a target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/publications/">"A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States"</a>. 
            In this paper the authors analysed the disparity in the treatment of people of different skin color in the USA by police officers. 
            The authors were able to draw the conclusion that an officer’s behavior depends on the skin color of the persons they apprehend.
            In this extension, we went a step back and studied the individual police officers behaviours’ in that study.
            We tried to understand what attributes of an officer is likely to make <strong>the officer a “good cop”, or a “bad cop”</strong>.

        <p class="text-center"> 
          To that end, we used the racial bias formula proposed by the author of the paper.  
          <a href="#gcbc-formula">This formula</a> allows to determine which officer is a "Good Cop” or a “Bad cop” (a.k.a. the Good Cop Bad Cop formula). 
            We  used this formula as the main statistic for our analysis. This will be the atom in our new dataset if you will.
            In this project we studied the root causes of an officer’s racial bias. 
            We studied individual aspects of a police officer in order to determine in which proportion those characteristic determined the officer’s racial bias.
            We also studied how the racial bias is distributed over the USA in multiple cities and states.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Data description</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
        For this extension we used the data that <a target="_blank" href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">the Stanford lab made available on their website</a>.
          Each file provided by the lab describes information about police stops that occurred at a specific location in the USA.
          Not all files were as informative. For this reason we disregarded some police agencies’ data that did not allow to describe 
          an individual officer’s behaviour. The state of Missouri, among others, did not provide the police officers’ id which was essential 
          for computing the racial bias associated to an individual police officer. Other files did not provide date information about the stops
          described. Time was crucial for computing racial bias formula and hence those files also ended up in the garbage.
