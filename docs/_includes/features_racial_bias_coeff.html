		<hr class="primary">
		<p class="text">
	      Let’s observe if some officer’s features can be relevant to determine the racial bias coefficient.

		  If we take a look on the distribution of the racial bias coefficient over male and female, we can see that the distribution is the same. 
		  We can observe more outliers in the male distribution but we have a lot more data from male officer than female.

		  Note that it is also the case if we look the distribution for the Hispanic, white and black officers. 
		  We can note a little difference but it is not relevant.

		  If we observe the racial bias coefficient across the officer age, we can see that it is well balanced over the age. 
		  The slop of the regression plot in black is a little negative but since we have less data for older officers, 
		  the confidence interval is larger for more than 60 years old and this slop may finally be flat.

		  Like for the officer age, the racial bias coefficient is well balanced across the officer’s years of service.

		  Before this study, we thought that there were some features of officer’s profile which can be used 
		  to predict if an officer’s stop decision process is subject to a racial bias. 
		  But finally, we can see that the racial bias coefficient is very well-balanced over the features (or at least among those studied). 
		  Therefore, racial bias is something universal which can happen with each officer and can not be modelised, 
		  or not only by sex, age, race and years of service of an officer.
