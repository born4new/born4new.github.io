		  As we can observe, the racial bias coefficient follows a heavy-tailed distribution. 
		  We can note that few officers have not racial bias in their stop decision process. 
		  The majority of officers have a little or a medium bias in their process. 
		  Also, few officers show a large racial bias and some rare case show extra-large racial bias.

		  As we can see, the distribution of the racial bias coefficient is not the same over each state patrols. 
		  We can note that the Michigan seems to be the state where there is the most officer with high racial bias in there stops decisions process. 
		  We can also note that we find again a heavy-tailed distribution of the racial bias coefficient in most states.

			The map below is a good tool to visualize the distribution of racially biased officers geographically.
				Interestingly neighbouring states seem to share similar racial biases. For example we observe that the South-Eastern 
				states like North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida with a median racial bias around <i>0.076</i>. Nevada and California
				share similar statistics as well. The southern states used to be part of the same coalition which fought during
				the american civil war in favour of keeping slavery a thing.
				Those states also had harsh segregation laws (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws">Jim Crow laws</a>).
				We expected that due to those deep historical reasons those states would perform poorly.

		<p>
				And we were surprised, Texas state showed the lowest racial bias in terms of quartiles. But one must note Texas' data also contains
				outliers that are more racially biased than the worse cops from Michigan. Even though Michigan overall does worse than Texas!
				This can be verified in the previous boxplot. Maybe something should be done to educate those outliers?
				Michigan (North near Canada), Connecticut (North-East), and Wyoming (North-West above Nevada) and should all receive a loser trophy, especially Michigan.
