	      Let’s take a look on the racial bias coefficient distribution over all patrols:

		  As we can observe, the racial bias coefficient follows a heavy-tailed distribution. 
		  We can note that few officers have not racial bias in their stop decision process. 
		  The majority of officers have a little or a medium bias in their process. 
		  Also, few officers show a large racial bias and some rare case show extra-large racial bias.

		  Now, let’s take a look on the distributions over state patrols:

		  <img src="img/box_state_patrol_RBC.png" alt="Distribution of the racial bias coefficient over state patrols" width="30%">
		</div>
		<p class="text">
		  As we can see, the distribution of the racial bias coefficient is not the same over each state patrols. 
		  We can note that the Michigan seems to be the state where there is the most officer with high racial bias in there stops decisions process. 
		  We can also note that we find again a heavy-tailed distribution of the racial bias coefficient in most states.
